# Tomato Disease Classification Balanced Dataset using Keras Tuner

## Overview

This project focuses on training a deep learning model for classifying tomato diseases (balanced dataset) using keras-tuner.

## Evaluation

Classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed. The accuracy of the model was found to be 10% which is less than previously trained model where CNN layer was hardcoded.
