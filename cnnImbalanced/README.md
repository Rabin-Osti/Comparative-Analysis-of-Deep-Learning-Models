# Tomato Disease Classification with Imbalanced Dataset

## Overview

This project focuses on training a deep learning model for classifying tomato diseases using an imbalanced dataset. The dataset contains images of tomatoes affected by various diseases, and the goal is to build a model that can accurately identify the disease class.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the "Dataset" directory, and it comprises images of tomatoes across multiple disease categories. Notably, the dataset is imbalanced, meaning that some disease categories have significantly fewer images compared to others.

## Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on the test set. Classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed. The accuracy of the model was found to be 12%.
