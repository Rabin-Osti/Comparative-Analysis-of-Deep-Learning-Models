# Tomato Disease Classification Balanced Dataset

## Overview

This project focuses on training a deep learning model for classifying tomato diseases using balanced dataset. The dataset contains images of tomatoes affected by various diseases, and the goal is to build a model that can accurately identify the disease class.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the "Dataset" directory, and it comprises images of tomatoes across multiple disease categories. In each category there are 1000 images i.e the dataset is balanced.

## Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on the test set. Classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed. The accuracy of the model was found to be 14%.
